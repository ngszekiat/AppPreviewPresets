# AppPreviewPresets
Presets for exporting videos for your iOS App Previews in `.EPR` files. Designed to work with Adobe Premiere and Adobe Media Encoder.

These presets are created based on the `H.264` encoding from [Appleâ€™s App Preview specifications.](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/Properties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH26-SW10)

Download and import presets via Adobe Media Encoder or Adobe Premiere. 

The suffix in the file name denotes the display size for the device, for example `App Preview 40.epr` is the preset for 4.0 inch device, i.e iPhone 5 or iPhone 5S.
